IMPORTANT TO ADD IF POSSIBLE:
palette:
    - bold, underlind, italics
    - colors
    - small text size, medium text size, large text size
    
notelist:
    - if a panel is clicked, sends you to the note fragment and loads the data and content from that note
    
functionality that could be improved:
    - notelist update lags
    - notelist doesnt show that files have been deleted immediately
    - some notes are saved without the date saving (probably because of where/how date is saved in notefragment.  wasnt sure of a better way to do this)


CAN ADD IF WE HAVE TIME:
settings fragment:
    - delete button deletes notes lol.  could implement a dialog box to ask/double check with the user to see if they really want to delete their notes
        - ALSO delete button is very finicky and notelist does not update immediately when notes are deleted.
    - add more preferences because currently there are only three: personal email, delete notes, and share notes with others (although this last preference doesnt do anything)
    

WHAT I'VE DONE:
    - set up basic functionality for everything except palette fragment
        - save notes to internal storage 
        - show the list of notes using notelist adapter
        - preferences page
        - delete notes in settings
